# Emotional-Intelligent-Analyzer

Despite the fact that Everything can be access through online, we
have been facing some problems regarding computer behavior.
as We assume that this problem is more serious after the
pandemic situation, but we need to evaluate more thoroughly to
find the best solutions to this problem.
Two popular methods utilized mostly in the
literature for the automatic FER systems are based on geometry
and appearance. Facial Expression Recognition usually performed
in four-stages consisting of pre-processing, face detection, feature
extraction, and expression classification. In this project we applied
various deep learning methods (convolutional neural networks) to
identify the key seven human emotions: anger, disgust, fear,
happiness, sadness, surprise and neutrality.
With the advent of modern technology our
desires went high and it binds no bounds. In the present era a
huge research work is going on in the field of digital image and
image processing. The way of progression has been exponential
and it is ever increasing. Image Processing is a vast area of
research in present day world and its applications are very
widespread.
